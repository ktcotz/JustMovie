## 💡 Why I Built This

As an aspiring frontend developer, I wanted to build something real-world and user-focused – not just another to-do app.  
This project helped me:

- Connect to external APIs (TMDB)
- Implement user authentication and storage (Supabase)
- Build a clean UI using TailwindCSS
- Work with forms, validation, pagination, uploads, and multi-language support

All features were planned, designed, and developed by me.
